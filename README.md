TextBlob is a Python library for processing text data. 
It provides a simple API for delving into common natural language processing tasks such as tagging part of speech, extracting nominal sentences, analyzing feelings, classifying, translating, and more.
This is how we can write a python program using the TextBlob library for correcting spellings. 
This feature can be used in Natural language processing projects in Machine Learning.
